# Introduction #

Consider the DataFieldEntity to be a field, part of a row, to be inserted to the database.

Each DataFieldEntity contains a pointer to the key of a value in a ValueStore.
It also contains metadata needed for the consumer to consume the data correctly.

The ProducesValue property, tells the consumer that this DataFieldEntity is expecting data to be generated by the database.
If that property is set to true, then the consumer must extract the generated value from the datastore and put it into the ValueStore.
